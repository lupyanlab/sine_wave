# Sine wave experiment (+Mooneys!)

Clone, install psychopy v3 and dependencies (https://www.psychopy.org/download.html), and run
`python sine_wave.py` (using Python 3). 

## Notes
* Uses psychtoolbox driver for sounds
* Uses some functions from a LupyanLab library file - useful_functions_python3.py
* If the text or images are not not centered, you'll want to downgrade pyglet (the library used by psychopy to display stims): `pip uninstall pyglet` then `pip install pyglet==1.3.2`
